Hello! I'm Shohei Shibata, the person who created and manages this website. I hope you are finding this website to be helpful.

The aim of this website to support the jazz music scene in and around Dayton, Ohio. I wanted to make it easy for you to find great live jazz music in the area. The listing on this website is constantly updated, and if you sign up for the newsletter, you will receive a summary of upcoming events every week.

Although I try my best to find all the upcoming events and add to the website, I know I am far from perfect. Please help me by <Link to="/events/add">submitting events</Link> that you don't see on the website! 

If you have any ideas or suggestions on how to improve this website, please <Link to="/contact">contact me</Link> and let me know!
